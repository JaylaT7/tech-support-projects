# Home Lab Project: Windows 11 Installation and Troubleshooting 

## Project Overview 

This project documents the process of installing Windows 11 on a personal computer as part of a home lab setup. The goal was to gain hands-on experience relevant to help desk roles, particularly in troubleshooting installation issues.


## Key Takeaways
- Successfully installed Windows 11 on a personal computer.

- Encountered and resolved an issue where the WiFi page failed to load during installation. 

- Demonstrated problem-solving skills by identifying the root cause and finding a workaround. 

- Utilized an Ethernet cable with a converter to establish a network connection and complete the installation. 

- Executed additional updates to fix a malfunctioning WiFi driver, enhancing network connectivity. 

- Discovered that a built-in product key in the motherboard can bypass the need for a Windows product key during installation. 

## Installation Steps

1. **Download Windows 11 ISO File**: 
	- Note: Windows 11 Pro is for businesses, not individuals. 

	- Ensure your data is backed up (e.g., using OneDrive).

2. **Prepare for Installation**: 
	- If installing a new hard drive or performing a clean install, note that all data on the drive will be erased. 

3. **Installation Process**: 
	- Boot from the Windows 11 installation media. 

	- Follow the on-screen instructions until you reach the network setup page. 

4. **Troubleshooting Network Issues**: 
	- If the WiFi page fails to load, use an Ethernet cable with a converter to establish a network connection. 

	- Complete the installation process. 

5. **Post-Installation Updates**: 
- Run additional Windows 11 updates to fix any driver issues, such as a malfunctioning WiFi driver.

## Additional Notes 
- **Built-in Product Key**: If your PC has a built-in product key in the motherboard, you may not need to enter a product key during installation. Look for a thumb fingerprint sticker on your PC to confirm this. 

## Conclusion 
This project highlights the importance of problem-solving and adaptability in IT roles. By documenting the installation and troubleshooting process, it serves as a valuable reference for similar future tasks.
